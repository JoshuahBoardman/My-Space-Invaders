# My Crypto Invaders

## Description
This is my version of the 70s game Space Invaders with a crypto curency theme.

## Motive
I wanted to improve my ability to work with JS modules and develop confidence in my understanding of JS.

## What I Learned 
I learned how to use parcel module bundler and utilize it in my projects. I also grew my ability to debug the code I write and solve problems I haven't faced before.
